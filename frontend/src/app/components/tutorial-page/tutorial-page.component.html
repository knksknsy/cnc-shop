             <h2>1. Choosing your Image</h2>
              First things first, you need to choose an image that will make a good stencil (or draw your own).
              Too much detail is hard to cut out and the stencil will become weak.
             <h2>2. Designing the Stencil </h2>
              The next step is to pick out the darkest and lightest parts of the image.
              Squinting at the image will help. Another method is to use Photoshop to make the image high contrast and black and white.
             <h2>3.Islands and Bridges </h2>
              So leave small gaps / bridges to all the white bits. Say you have black around the eyes, 
              but you want the white bits left. Leave a gap in the black.This will connect it to rest of the face. 
              This will come naturally after some tries and mistakes.

             <h2>4. Careful Cutting </h2>
              Cutting out your stencil design is probably the most fiddly bit. Here are some tips to stay safe:
              1) Go slow and cut lightly.
              2) Always cut away from yourself
              3) Make sure your hand is behind the blade, that way if you slip you won‛t cut your finger.
                                                            
             <h2>5. Spraying your Stencil</h2>
              Once you‛re happy with your stencil, it‛s time to spray! Think about the surface / 
              material you want your image on (t-shirt, bag, wall, poster...). 
              Spray quickly and evenly from about 15-25cm away, otherwise the paint will drip (unless you want drips).
              Wait 30secs until the paints dry and lift off your stencil to see your design.

             <h2>6. Other things to try...</h2>
              You can try spraying on different backgrounds, like cloth or tissue. You can make a 2 or 3 colour image with multiple stencils. 
              What else can you try?
              <h5>Quick Tip:</h5>
              Keep your design simple and bold.
              <h5>Quick Tip:</h5>
              You can paint gaps in later. Dab with a finger or brush.
              <h5>Quick Tip:</h5>
              Put some tape over really deli- cate areas before cutting to make them stronger.
              <h5>Quick Tip:</h5>
              Turning the image as you work will ensure smooth cutting and help you get into corners.
